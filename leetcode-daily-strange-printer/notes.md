Solved! 🎉 "Strange Printer" Problem on LeetCode 💻

Hey fellow coders! 👋 Today, I tackled the "Strange Printer" problem on LeetCode, and I'm excited to share my experience with you! 🤩

Problem Statement: 📝

Given a string s, find the minimum number of turns required to print the string using a strange printer that can print a substring in one turn if the characters in the substring are the same.

My Approach: 💡

To solve this problem, I utilized dynamic programming (DP):

Consecutive Duplicate Removal: First, I optimized the input by removing consecutive duplicates. This simplifies the problem by reducing the search space, as repeated characters next to each other don't need to be printed separately.

DP Table Construction:

I constructed a 2D DP table dp[i][j] where each entry represents the minimum number of turns required to print the substring from index i to j. The idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and use previous results to build the solution.

Next Occurrence Vector:

To enhance the solution, I maintained a next_occurrence vector to store the next occurrence of each character. This allowed me to consider future occurrences of the same character, which could help in minimizing the number of turns needed by avoiding unnecessary prints.

Filling the DP Table:

Starting with base cases where substrings of length 1 (single characters) take only one turn to print, I then filled the table for larger substrings by considering different splitting points. The solution leverages the next_occurrence vector to optimize the process further.

Takeaways: 📚

Dynamic Programming: This problem highlights the power of DP in solving complex problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems.

Optimizing Input: Simplifying the input by removing consecutive duplicates can significantly reduce complexity.

Future Considerations: The use of a next_occurrence vector demonstrates the importance of thinking ahead to make better decisions in algorithm design.

Performance Across Languages 🌐

Insights on Language Performance:

C++ and Java are the top performers, with very low runtime.

Rust also shines with an impressive runtime and minimal memory usage.

Python and Ruby are comparatively slower, with Ruby consuming the most memory.
